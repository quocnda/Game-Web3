## About the Project
In today's digital age, the demand for games that allow players to earn money is rising rapidly. Classic card games often lack modern mechanisms to ensure trust in asset ownership and trading methods.

This project leverages blockchain technology to link each player's **Metamask wallet account** with their in-game assets, enabling secure ownership and trade of assets. By combining the thrill of card games with the security and potential of blockchain, we aim to redefine the gaming experience.
